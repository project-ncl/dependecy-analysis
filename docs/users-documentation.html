        <h1>Dependency Analyser - User's documentation</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This project is a service, which provides information about built artifacts and
            analyse the projects' dependencies. It can lookup the Red Hat build artifacts and inform
            the users about alternatives instead of the artifacts used in their projects, produces
            dependency reports of artifacts and resolves dependency tree.</p>

        <p>The Dependency Analyser also maintains a database of whitelisted and blacklisted
            artifacts, which should help the user to decide, which artifacts to use in their
            projects.</p>
        <p>
            This project is hosted on
            <a href="https://github.com/project-ncl/dependency-analysis">GitHub</a>
            and developed mainly by the JBoss Productization team, but external contributors are
            welcome.
        </p>

        <h3>Blacklist / Whitelist</h3>
        <p>The service maintains the database of the whitelisted and blacklisted artifacts. This
            data in the database can be change by any user right now, but in future it will be
            restricted only to authorized users.</p>
        <p>The meaning of the this lists is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="strong">Whitelist</span>
                - contains artifacts, which are the best option to be used in the projects. Each
                artifact is associated to a particular product. These
                artifacts are used in the latest versions of the most important products and
                therefore they are supported. The inserted artifacts are restricted to RedHat build
                versions of artifacts (e.g. 4.2.18.Final).
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="strong">Blacklist</span>
                - contains artifacts, which should not be used in the projects. There are typically
                artifacts, which cannot be built, has unacceptable license, contains
                vulnerabilities, etc. The inserted artifacts are restricted to community versions of
                artifacts (e.g. 4.2.18.Final).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Artifacts, which are not in any of the lists are treated as graylisted, so there is
            no guarantee they are suitable to be used in products and they should instead be judged
            manually.</p>

        <h3>Lookup of built artifacts</h3>
        <p>The Dependency Analyser can lookup the Red Hat built artifacts and tell the user if
            the artifact was built or not and provide him alternative versions of the artifact. The
            user gets the information about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The latest built version of the artifact</li>
            <li>All built versions of artifacts with the same GroupId, ArtifactId</li>
            <li>Blacklist/whitelist status of the requested artifact</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Dependency reports</h3>
        The system is able to provide information about the dependencies of a project. It can
        analyse a specific GAV or a repository specified by the URL (+ revision). This feature
        extends the lookup and it resolves whole dependency tree and provides information for every
        artifact in the tree and also some helper data like how many dependencies are not built.

        <h3>Data source</h3>
        <p>
            Currently data about built artifacts are gathered from the public product repository
            (<a href="http://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga">maven.repository.redhat.com</a>).
            The dependency analyser has an option to easily add any Maven repository as a source
            of supported built artifacts.
        </p>
        <p>The integration with Brew/MEAD repositories is mostly done and soon the DA
        will proxy also artifacts from the candidate tags. There is also a possibility to add any Mead repository as a
            source repository for the Dependency Analyser (e.g. repositories of the latest products
            builds).</p>
        <p>In the future the Dependency Analyser will provide also built artifacts from the Project
            Newcastle build system, once it is in production.</p>


        <h2>Interfaces</h2>
        <p>
            The Dependency Analyser is a server side application and there are two ways how to use
            it. The
            <span class="strong">REST API</span>,
            which provides the main logic of the system and provides an easy way to use it in
            other applications, and the
            <span class="strong">CLI tools</span>,
            which are more handy for the manual usage. The CLI tools are mainly a thin client,
            which performs gets all data from the service using the REST API.
        </p>
        <p>It's planned to have a third interface, which will be the UI of the Project Newcastle
            build system.</p>

        <h3>REST API</h3>
        <p>
            The REST API is based on the Swagger documentation, which provides an easy way to have
            an up to date documentation and also a simple way to try the REST API from the browser.
            The path to the Swagger documentation is
            <span class="strong">/da/doc </span>
            . From this endpoint there is also link to the latest API version.
        </p>
        <p>This interface is also versioned in the URL (e.g. v-0.3). The same version
            guarantees, that there are no backward incompatible changes. Currently only the latest
            version of REST API is maintained, but in production there can be more running API
            versions.</p>

        <h3>CLI tools</h3>
        <p>The CLI tools are more handy for the manual usage. Most of the data is obtained from
            the server application, so it is not possible to use the CLI tools without connection to
            the server. The tools are a simple Python scripts, which requires to have installed
            interprets for Python 3.5 and above.</p>


        <h2>CLI tools manual</h2>
        <p>In this section will be described how to use the CLI tools and what are their
            options.</p>

        <h3>Installation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p>
                The easiest way to make the CLI tools running is to
                <a href="https://github.com/project-ncl/dependency-analysis/raw/version-1.0.x/cli-wrap/da-cli-tools-1.0.0-pack.zip">download the ZIP archive</a>
                from GitHub, which contains all the required support scripts and CLI tool. The
                latest versions of the scripts are always placed in the folder /cli. When you download the
                ZIP file, you can unzip the file and start using it.
                How to do that?
                <ol>
                    <li>Unzip the CLI: unzip da-cli-tools-1.0.0-pack.zip</li>
                    <li>Enter the folder with CLI: cd da-cli-tools-1.0.0</li>
                    <li>Change permissions: chmod +x *.py</li>
                    
                </ol>
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Second option is to clone Dependency Analyser repository via git:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/project-ncl/dependency-analysis</li>
                            <li>Enter the directory with the CLI: cd dependency-analysis/cli-wrap/src/main/resources/cli/</li>
                            <li>Change permissions: chmod +x *.py</li>
                            
                        </ol>
                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                After unpacking/clonning CLI tool, you need to configure servers.
            <p>
                You have to specify DA server and KeyCloak authentication server. It can be done by inserting URL addresses of these servers to file config.json 
                DA server should be filled into "daServer" field. This server has to support WebSocket and HTTP protocol. Keycloak server should be in field "keycloakServer".
                There are also "keycloakClientId" and "keycloakRealm" fields, which should be filled by your KeyCloak configuration for proper working scripts. 
                DA server can be also set as environmental variable ($ export DA_SERVER=...).
                <i>Note that DA server must be inserted protocol-less because services are using different protocols.</i>
                In case one of these server is not specified, script exits with fail message.
            </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Before first run
            <p>
                Ensure that you have installed python3 (more specific 3.5), requests, websockets and asyncio modules. Websockets should contain asyncio module, so these two modules are installed just by websocked install command.
            </p>
            If you do not have them installed, it can be easily done by these commands:
                <ul>
                    <li>On Fedora 24+ you can install it using dnf install python3 python3-requests python3-websockets</li>
                    <li>On other systems you can use prepared scrpip install-python3.5.sh</li>
                    
                </ul>
            Try to run the CLI. E.g.: ./da-cli.py lookup org.hibernate:hibernate-core:4.2.21.Final        
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Options description</h3>
        <p>There is a couple of options, which can define the behavior of the CLI tool. The more
            complex options are described in this section. If you want to see description of all the
            available options you can find it in the help of the tool.</p>
        <p>The output of the tool is delimited by the tab, but in this section the data are
            displayed in the list, which strictly conforms to the order of the output</p>


        <ul id="options">
            <li>
                <span class="strong">No parameters</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>The tool will print the help with a basic description of options</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="strong">Lookup built artifacts (lookup)</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lookups all built versions of the requested GA and reports if there is
                        any exact match to the requested GAV</li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="strong">Output:</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Requested GAV</li>
                            <li>RH version of the artifact or "None" if the artifact was not
                                found</li>
                            <li>blacklisted/greylisted/whitelisted</li>
                            <li>All built versions of the requested GA</li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="strong">Usage:</span>
                        ./da-cli.py lookup [GROUP_ID:ARTIFACT_ID[:PACKAGING[:CLASSIFIER]]:VERSION[:SCOPE]] [--products PRODUCTS] [--productIDs IDS]
                        <br />

                        When GROUP_ID:ARTIFACT_ID:VERSION is specified finds corresponding redhat versions for it.
                        When it is not specified, reads G:A:Vs from standard input and finds corresponding redhat versions for all of them.
                        Packaging, classifier and scope is ignored in both cases.
                        Consider artifact only from products specified by IDs ([--productIDs IDS]) or names ([--products PRODUCTS]).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Creates a dependency report for a single GAV. This option provides the
                        information from the lookup plus the same information also for dependencies
                        and some additional information like "how many transitive dependencies is
                        not built".
                        <br />
                        To make the output better readable the all available builds of GAVs are
                        collapsed to the single information "how many builds of GAV exists". To
                        display all the builds you can use parameter "--raw", which also provides
                        script-friendly output.
